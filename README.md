# pedigree.js

Pedigree.js is a small tool that I have created to automate some of the tedious task of creating a fictional family tree for characters.

## what it is

It's a random generator that creates fictional lineages for new characters so the author doesn't have to waste effort trying to come up with combinations. By offloading things to the generator, authors can hopefully create characters free of bias or characters who might not otherwise be chosen by authors.

## what it is not

This is not stable software. Anything prior to a 1.0.0 release should be considered to be pre-alpha software that you use at your own risk. 

In addition, this is not and will never be an actual genealogical tool.

## how to use this software

Download all the files to your computer and extract/unzip them as necessary. Github provides a handy button on this project page to download a zipped archive of all the code. Or you can use git to clone this repository. Whatever works for you.

Once you have all the files on your local computer, open up the "index.html" file in your web browser. It should draw a fancy pedigree chart for you automatically, but if you have a script blocker active, it may not work unless you turn the blocker off. I've only tested this in Chrome, but it should work for all modern major browsers.

Also, since the control panel at the top of the page is still just for decoration, you'll need to hit the F5 key/refresh page button to draw another pedigree chart.
